# Open Saber VR

Open Saber V2 is an open source remake of Open Saber VR. 

If you are interested in helping/contributing to the project (no matter if you are a coding monkey or 3D artist or just have some ideas), feel free to contact me, I will be more than happy to have some help. You can find the complete source code here, so if you want to contribute, just have a look there.


## Import songs
Just download any song from BeatSaver or BeastSaber and unzip it to the "OpenSaberVR_data/Playlists" folder. Make sure that each song has its own folder in the Playlists folder. After that run Open Saber VR and the song should be displayed in the menu.


## Gameplay

If you know how to play Beat Saber then you are good to go. If not then it's really simple to play, just cut the notes (beat blocks) at the side where the glow bar is with the saber in the same color. The blue saber is the right hand, the red saber is the left hand. The notes will be only sliced if you hit with the correct saber on the correct side. Otherwise the block will just went through.

There is no energy or anything right now, so you can't "lose" a game , the song will play until the end. Also there are no points right now, only some fun with the music.

After the song finished, just wait for 5 seconds and you will be pushed back to the main menu where you can select another song.
